                <h2>Affordable, practical training</h2>
                <p>The first Fortnite: Battle Royale college scholarship is here. It’s from Ashland University in Ohio, and will offer top Fortnite players $4,000 worth of tuition to join their newly formed esports program and compete on a squads team of four. This team will join their other esports offerings, Overwatch and League of Legends. Open tryouts for the squad will be announced sometime in the future. Ashland is a small school, only 4,600 students, and ranked 223rd in the country by US News and World Report. Some have accused smaller schools like this of trying to use esports as a publicity stunt, and while sure, it may partially be a marketing tactic, I don’t see any harm in it. These students are getting tuition money, and then getting an education as a result. Nothing wrong with that, and I don’t see why scholarships shouldn’t be awarded for video games if the school is determined enough to set up a dedicated program for it. Why not? </p>
