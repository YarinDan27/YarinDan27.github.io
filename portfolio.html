                <h3>Yarin Dan, Water vs Fire</h3>
                <h4>I am Yarin Dan and all my life is about fire and water and I wanted to know which one is better, it seems to me that they are mutually necessary for the creation and maintenance of life. Though when people try to weigh the two elements’ power they tend to consider only their effect on their “field of vision” meaning whatever exists on earth and its atmosphere. And while people know that fire can vanish the earth’s lungs, they know it can be stopped, unlike water. Water will go on and kill the population of a tsunami-stroke city and nobody can do anything about that.</h4>
